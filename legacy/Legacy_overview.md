# Legacy Imports

Dormant or archived Sovereign Codex repositories will be staged in this directory during the monorepo migration. Each imported project keeps its original layout under `/legacy/<repo>` so historical context remains available without interfering with active development.

## Guidelines

- Avoid modifying code in these folders unless you are actively reviving the project.
- Add a short status note to each legacy repository after import describing why it remains dormant.
- Link to any successor packages or applications from the legacy README to aid discovery.
